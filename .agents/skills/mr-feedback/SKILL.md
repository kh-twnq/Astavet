# GitLab MR Feedback Resolution Skill

Read [the Codex adaptation contract](../../../harness/references/codex-adaptation.md) before using this workflow.

Work through reviewer feedback on a GitLab Merge Request one discussion thread at a time:
fetch unresolved threads → apply the change → reply → resolve the thread.

## When to Use
- User says "resolve MR feedback" / "address review comments" / "fix the MR threads"
- A GitLab MR has unresolved discussions that need code changes or replies
- After a reviewer requests changes

## Prerequisites

**Required**: GitLab access via one of:
- [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI (recommended), authenticated (`glab auth status`), or
- GitLab REST API v4 with a token (`GITLAB_TOKEN`) via `curl`, or
- a GitLab MCP server if configured for the session.

> Resolving threads needs the **Developer** role or higher on the project.

### Key API concepts
- A **discussion** is a thread; it has `id` and `resolvable`/`resolved` flags.
- Each discussion holds **notes** (comments). The first note is the original feedback; read later replies before deciding whether it is still open.
- You **reply** by adding a note to the discussion, and **resolve** the discussion as a whole.

REST endpoints (base: `/projects/:id/merge_requests/:mr_iid`):
| Action | Method + path |
|--------|---------------|
| List threads | `GET .../discussions` |
| Reply to a thread | `POST .../discussions/:discussion_id/notes` |
| Resolve a thread | `PUT .../discussions/:discussion_id?resolved=true` |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the MR
Get project + MR IID from the user, the current branch, or:
```bash
glab mr list --source-branch "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

### Step 2 — Fetch UNRESOLVED threads only
```bash
glab api --paginate "projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/discussions?per_page=100"
```
Filter to discussions where `resolvable == true` and `resolved == false`. For each, capture:
- `discussion.id`
- the first note's `body` (the request), `author`, and `position` (file path + line).

Ignore non-resolvable system notes (label changes, "marked as draft", etc.).

### Step 3 — Triage each thread
Classify the feedback before acting:
| Type | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Code change requested** | Apply the change (Step 4), reply, resolve |
| **Question** | Reply with the answer; resolve only if no change needed |
| **Suggestion (optional)** | Apply if reasonable; otherwise reply with rationale, leave for reviewer |
| **Disagreement** | Reply with reasoning; do NOT resolve — leave for the reviewer to decide |

> Do not blindly resolve. Resolve a thread only when its concern is genuinely addressed.

### Step 4 — Apply the code change
For any code change, go through your project's write-time gate (e.g. [rules/java.md](../../../harness/rules/java.md)
for Java — self-explanatory code / no comments, tests, and the review gate). Make the smallest
change that fully addresses the comment — don't scope-creep beyond the feedback.

### Step 5 — Reply on the thread
Add a note that says what you did, referencing the commit if available:
```bash
glab api -X POST "projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/discussions/<discussion_id>/notes" \
  -f body="Done in <short-sha> — extracted validation into PluginValidator as suggested."
```
Keep replies short, factual, and specific. One reply per thread.

### Step 6 — Resolve the thread
Only after the reply, and only for addressed threads:
```bash
glab api -X PUT "projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/discussions/<discussion_id>?resolved=true"
```

### Step 7 — Commit & push
Group the fixes logically (defer wording to [commit](../commit/SKILL.md)); push to the MR's
source branch so the replies/commits line up:
```
fix(review): address MR feedback — extract validation, null-guard scan

Resolves review threads from <reviewer>.
```
Then confirm the pipeline is green.

## Token Optimization
- Fetch all discussion pages once; cache the complete list. Don't re-list after each resolve.
- Only read the file regions referenced by `position`, not whole files.
- Batch independent code changes, then reply+resolve each thread, then a single push.

## Anti-patterns
❌ Resolving a thread without actually addressing it (or without replying).
❌ Resolving threads where you disagreed — leave those for the reviewer.
❌ Re-listing discussions after every action (wastes tokens).
❌ Scope-creeping changes beyond what the comment asked.
✅ Triage → minimal correct change → short factual reply → resolve only when addressed.

## Example
```
> "Resolve the feedback on MR !42"
1. glab api discussions → 5 unresolved threads
2. triage: 3 code changes, 1 question, 1 disagreement
3. apply 3 changes via rules/java.md gate
4. reply + resolve the 3 code threads and the question
5. reply (no resolve) on the disagreement, explaining the trade-off
6. commit, push, confirm pipeline green → report summary
```
